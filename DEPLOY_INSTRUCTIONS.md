# 🚀 Deploy Your Fixed Blog to GitHub Pages

## The Issue Was Fixed! 

Your blog was getting a 404 error because the `baseurl` configuration didn't match your repository name. 

**Your repository**: `mlg`  
**Your site URL**: `https://momchilgeorgiev.github.io/mlg/`  
**Required baseurl**: `/mlg`

## ✅ Changes Made

1. **Updated `_config.yml`**: Set `baseurl: "/mlg"` to match your repository name
2. **Verified build**: The site builds correctly with the new configuration
3. **Tested links**: All internal links now include the correct `/mlg/` prefix

## 📋 Deploy Now

Run these commands to deploy the fix:

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit the fix
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages baseurl for mlg repository"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## ⏱️ Wait for Deployment

- GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild your site (1-10 minutes)
- Check the "Actions" tab in your repository for build progress
- Once complete, your site will work at: `https://momchilgeorgiev.github.io/mlg/`

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

After deployment, you should be able to:
- ✅ Visit `https://momchilgeorgiev.github.io/mlg/` (homepage)
- ✅ Navigate to `https://momchilgeorgiev.github.io/mlg/blog/` (blog page)
- ✅ Click links in the navigation menu
- ✅ Search posts on the blog page
- ✅ View individual blog posts

## 🎯 Alternative: Rename Repository (Optional)

If you prefer a cleaner URL without `/mlg/`, you could:

1. **Rename your repository** to `momchilgeorgiev.github.io`
2. **Change baseurl back** to `""` in `_config.yml`
3. **Your site would be** at `https://momchilgeorgiev.github.io/`

But your current setup with `/mlg/` will work perfectly fine!
